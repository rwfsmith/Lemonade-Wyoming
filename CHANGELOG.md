# Changelog

## 0.3.6

- Fix: add `custom_components/lemonade_ha/translations/en.json` so HA can
  discover the integration in the "Add Integration" dialog
  (HA reads `translations/en.json` at runtime; `strings.json` alone is not enough)

## 0.3.5

- Fix: add `s6-rc.d/user/contents.d/lemonade-ha` so s6-overlay actually starts the service
  (without this file the run script was silently skipped and nothing happened)

## 0.3.4

- Remove HEALTHCHECK — Docker now marks container healthy immediately,
  stopping the HA watchdog restart loop
- Add build-time import verification to catch Python errors during `docker build`

## 0.3.3

- Add native HA custom integration (`custom_components/lemonade_wyoming`)
  which registers STT, TTS, and conversation agent directly — no manual
  Wyoming Protocol integration entries needed
- Add-on automatically copies the custom component to the HA config directory
  on startup; restart HA once to load it, then configure via
  Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Lemonade HA

## 0.3.2

- Fix HEALTHCHECK: use `nc -z` (port-open check) instead of Wyoming protocol
  framing that was always failing and causing the watchdog restart loop

## 0.3.1

- Fix HEALTHCHECK start-period from 10 minutes to 30 seconds so HA Supervisor
  sees the container as healthy within its 120-second startup window

## 0.3.0

- Fix startup timeout: Wyoming TCP ports now open immediately; Lemonade
  connection and model downloads happen in the background
- Handlers queue voice requests until Lemonade is ready (up to 10 minutes)
  instead of failing with a timeout error

## 0.2.0

- Restructure LLM configuration by backend (llamacpp / ryzenai / flm)
- Full model list from server_models.json (~110 models across all backends)
- Per-backend model dropdowns in HA configuration UI

## 0.1.0

- Initial release
- Speech-to-Text via Whisper (whisper.cpp / FastFlowLM)
- LLM conversation agent via LLama.cpp / RyzenAI / FastFlowLM
- Text-to-Speech via Kokoro
- Automatic model download on first launch
- Home Assistant add-on with configuration UI
